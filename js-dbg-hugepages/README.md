# JavaScript fuzzer (E2)

Make sure you have downloaded the SpiderMonkey shell. More info in the top-level README and Artifact Appendix. Unlike the exploit in `js-exploit`, the JavaScript fuzzer relies on huge pages.

To run the fuzzer, use: `make clean && make; make` to ignore the transpiler errors.
